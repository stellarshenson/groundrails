"""Numeric and named-entity contradiction detection between claim and passage.

Used by :func:`grounding.ground` when some layer has a positive signal. If a
number or named entity appears in the claim with a differing value in the
matched passage (but same category / context word), we record a mismatch.

Design points:
    - Regex-only. No ML. Deterministic.
    - Compares claim tokens against the winning passage only. The full source
      is not scanned because we only flag direct disagreement between claim
      and its own best evidence.
    - Tolerates unit formatting variations ("1,000" == "1000", "10 %" == "10%").
    - Tech-entity whitelist catches common "H100 vs A100" style contradictions.

Public API:
    :func:`extract_numbers` -> list of (value, unit, context_word)
    :func:`extract_entities` -> list of named-entity strings
    :func:`find_mismatches` -> (numeric_mismatches, entity_mismatches)

Each mismatch is ``(claim_value, passage_value)`` suitable for
``GroundingMatch.numeric_mismatches`` / ``entity_mismatches``.
